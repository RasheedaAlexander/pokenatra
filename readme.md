# Pokenatra

We decided that it would be better to ride on the coat tails of the latest craze, Pokemon Go. We want YOU to create a web app that mirrors much of the same functionality as the popular mobile app!

# Objectives

Build at least a single model application on the Sinatra Application that allows for the creating, reading, updating and deleting of a Pokemon.

# Stack
+ Ruby
+ Sinatra

# Steps to get started
```
bundle install

ruby app.rb
```
# Visit site on
```
http://localhost:4567/pokemons
```
